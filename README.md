# ibFinder

This is a tool to find out, explore and configure Bluetooth Smart beacons managed under the server-side Content Management System / Customer Self-Management (CMS/CSM) produced by iBecom LLC.

ibFinder fully supports iBecom beacons to configure, firmware update, monitor with post data to server and graph visualization.

ibFinder supports Kontakt beacons to configure, monitor with post data to server and graph visualization. It works better, more stable and user-friendly than official Kontakt application. You need to know Kontakt DevCode to use ibFinder.

ibFinder supports Estomote beacons to monitor and graph visualization.

ibFinder works on iOS platform only. On iOS 7 it is possible to monitor each Bluetooth broadcast channel (#37, #38, #39) separatly. Keep your iOS 7 tech tool devices out of upgrade to iOS 8 - new iOS system doesn't support this feature.

You can download ibFinder free at AppStore. To test ibFinder you can get binary ipa image here and install it directly to your iPhone/iPad (Enterprise deployment for testing purposes only, updates may be unsupported).
